Deox is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute:

-   **Q/A**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (i.e. REPL-links or repos that demonstrate the specific issue)
-   **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
-   **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...
-   **Code**: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
